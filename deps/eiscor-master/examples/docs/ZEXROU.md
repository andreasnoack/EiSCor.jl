# ZEXROU #
_Zomplex EXample Roots Of Unity_

In this example the roots of unity are computed by solving the eigenvalue problem for a corresponding permuation matrix. This example solves it two ways:
 1. Form the permutation matrix explicitly and then call [__ZUHFQR__]().
 2. Form the permutation matrix implicitly in factored form and then call [__ZUFFQR__]().
